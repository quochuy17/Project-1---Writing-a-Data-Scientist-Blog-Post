# Project : Wine Review Data Analysis
    + In general, this project is just analyze on the wine dataset and then explore the valuable insights and show on the Blog post.
    
## Software used
    + Anaconda, python, Visual Studio Code, Jupiter Notebook, Google Colab
## Some needed libraries
 - For doing this prject, my plan is just use some libraries below:
    + NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn
    + Matplotlib, Wordcloud, Pillow

## Project Motivation
Firstly, the dataset i used for implementing this project is:
    + Source: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews containing approximately 130k reviews from the [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) to better understand:
    + Dataset's content: display about  130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description of numerous type of wine in all over the world.
Next, i will define and analyze on some below questions including:    
    + Where does the world's best wine was made?
    + Whether sellers evaluate the wine's quality based on its price?
    + Are certain wines of a greater caliber than others?
    + What wine falls into each price range's top tier?

## Project target
- For this analysis and the related insights of this project, I just I wanted the chance to investigate the data and share my findings through a blog post on Medium.
- Besides that, it is also the way which is hoped to be interesting and provide the reader with insight into the issues raised and help people know more about the wine's world and the potential market.

## Project's implementing steps:
It will contain some main steps for completing this project:
1) Pick a dataset, as mentioned on the previous page.
2) Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.
3) Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages, to:
+ Prepare data
+ Gather necessary data to answer the questions
+ Handle categorical and missing data
+ Provide insight into the methods for chosing and why i chose them
+ Analyze, Model, and Visualize
+ Provide a clear connection between the business questions and how the data answers them
4) Communicate the related business insights:
+ Create a Github repository to share the code and data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind
+ Create a blog post to share the questions and insights with a non-technical audience

## Project's requirements:
- The blog must provide the following:
 + A clear and engaging title and image.
 + The related questions of interest and the findings for those questions with a supporting statistic(s), table, or visual.
 + A README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.
 + The code in a Jupyter notebook, with appropriate comments, analysis, and documentation.
 + And it also provides any other necessary documentation.

## Medium Blog Post 
+ When finsishing all above steps, the insights of the analysing process is showed on the Blog post:
